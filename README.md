ResMAG is a state-of-the-art and user-friendly Snakemake workflow designed for the analysis of metagenomic data. It integrates multiple bioinformatics tools and algorithms to facilitate key steps in metagenome analysis, including quality control, assembling, bin refinement, metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) reconstruction and taxonomic classification. ResMAG has a special focus on highly diverse samples, such as wastewater, and the identification of antibiotic resistance genes.<br />

## Key Features

**Binning Techniques**: Employ a collection of two state-of-the-art binning tools to partition metagenomic contigs into individual bins, allowing for comprehensive and accurate analysis.<br />

**MAG Reconstruction**: Utilize cutting-edge algorithms to reconstruct high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), especially from highly diverse microbial communities, like wastewater.<br />

**Taxonomic Classification**: Apply advanced taxonomic classification methods to assign taxonomic labels to reads, contigs and MAGs and identify the microbial community composition within the metagenomic samples.<br />

**Antibiotic Resistance Gene Identification**: Perform in-depth analysis to detect and characterize antibiotic resistance genes within the metagenomic data, providing valuable insights into antimicrobial resistance profiles.<br />

**Culture-free evidence profile**: Optionally retain assembly/linkage evidence, run paired-mate direct
DIAMOND--UniCARD searches before assembly, preserve full competitive hit fields, export typed ARO
category accessions from pinned CARD data, and checksum-lock every AMR database artifact. These outputs
are research evidence and are not resistance, susceptibility, or clinical calls.<br />

**Performance Refinement**: Continuously optimize the pipeline by incorporating the latest advancements in metagenomics research, ensuring the highest accuracy and efficiency in metagenomic data analysis.<br />

## Overview

## Preparations

Create a snakemake environment using [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) via:

 ```mamba create -c conda-forge -c bioconda -n snakemake snakemake snakemake-storage-plugin-fs```

For installation details, see the [instructions in the Snakemake documentation](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html).

### Download GTDB
The GTDB needs to be downloaded and decompressed, it requires about 140 Gb.

1. Change to the directory where the GTDB should be stored
2. Download the latest or your desired version of GTDB
   Please make sure this version is compatible with GTDB-tk version `2.6.1`
   ```
   wget https://data.ace.uq.edu.au/public/gtdb/data/releases/latest/auxillary_files/gtdbtk_package/full_package/gtdbtk_data.tar.gz
   ```
3. Decompress the downloaded archive
   ```
   tar xzf gtdbtk_data.tar.gz
   ```
4. After successful step 3: the archive can be removed
5. Please specify the path to your decompressed GTDB in the config file (see [Configuring workflow](#configuring-the-workflow))

### Create UniCARD database
Please follow the steps outlined in the [UniCARD repository](https://github.com/IKIM-Essen/uniCARD) to create a UniCARD database for resistance gene annotation.
And specify the path to your database in the config file (see [Configuring workflow](#configuring-the-workflow))

---

## Usage

Please obtain a copy of this workflow by [cloning](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/IKIM-Essen/metagenomics_res.git
```

### Configuring the workflow
1. Edit the `config/config.yaml` file:
   - Specify a project name (`project-name`)
   - Specify filtering options for human reads (`human-filtering`)
   - Specify host filtering options, if you have a non-human host (`host-filtering`)
   - Specify options for different databases:
     - GTDB database needs to be downloaded before (see [Download GTDB](#download-gtdb))
     - UniCARD database needs to be create before (see [Create UniCARD database](#create-unicard-database))
     - other databases (kaiju, CheckM2, CARD, genomad) can be given as a local path or downloaded when running the pipeline
2. Provide sample information in the `config/pep/samples.csv` file while keeping the header and the format as:

```
sample_name,fq1,fq2
sample1,path/to/your/fastq/sample1_R1.fastq.gz,path/to/your/fastq/sample1_R2.fastq.gz
```

For culture-free AMR development, enable `culture-free-evidence` in `config/config.yaml`, replace the
UniCARD builder/UniRef placeholders with the exact database provenance, and decide whether to retain the
large assembly intermediates and BAM/BAI files. RGI-BWT is optional and disabled in the example profile;
direct DIAMOND--UniCARD evidence is emitted separately for R1 and R2 with 18 fields so mate identity and
competing CARD wild-type/UniRef hits are not collapsed. The CARD category export retains canonical
`ARO:` identifiers; the legacy UniCARD hierarchy labels are display-only.


### Run the workflow
Activate the conda environment:
```conda activate snakemake```

Test your configuration by performing a dry-run via
```snakemake --use-conda -n```

Executing the workflow:
```snakemake --use-conda --cores $N -k```

using `$N` cores. It is recommended to use all available cores.
